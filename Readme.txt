Paper Tiger
===========
Scanning, text recognition and archiving of paper documents... 
with GUI clients but from the command line if necessary 

The Paper Tiger code has a liberal MIT license. 
It uses various other open-source programs.

Functionality
=============
Architecture/functionality:
- scanning documents using sane into TIFF documents
- OCR/text recognition using Tesseract
- storage of documents as PDF file (image file+OCR text) e.g. on a Samba share
- index of documents+notes+full text in Firebird database
- server component written in FreePascal, so no X Windows required.
- command line control on server
- CGI REST server component
- GUI viewer/scanner controls written in Lazarus+FreePascal; 
  communicates using REST


Further possible refinements:
- support for other databases (sqlite, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server)
- using image cleanup tools such as scantailor and unpaper
- using WIA etc on Windows to support Windows scanners
- write .deb install pacakge for easy installation on Debian servers
- batch import of images/pdfs

Architecture and development principles
- use other people's work if possible - the Unix way...
- if possible, build using modules: 
  e.g. allow use of multiple OCR engines etc
- store OCR text in the PDF, and store the image tiff.
  This enables external tools to work with the PDFs, 
	use the PDFs in other applications etc.
- save all OCR text in database or file 
  (e.g. a Lucene index) in order to allow fast search across all documents
- this means synchronizing PDF text with the full text archive may be required
- develop towards a single point of control: 
  tigerservercore, which may speak multiple protocols, e.g. via plugins
- however, use standard methods of storing data (e.g. full text search 
  components), normalized database schema in order to allow programs/tools that 
	don't speak the protocols mentioned above to get data easily
- these 2 principles clash; the code will need to stabilize until it is wise to 
  directly try to access e.g. the database.
	Even then, breaking changes will not be avoided if e.g. cleanness of design 
	would be compromised

Compilation instructions
========================
FPC 2.7.1/trunk is preferred for the server/CGI programs.
At least FPC 2.6.2 fpweb does not accept the DELETE method.
For the client program, Lazarus trunk has been used for development.

1. Compile hgversion.pas, e.g.:
fpc hgversion.pas

2. Compile the program(s) you want
2.1 With Lazarus:
lazbuild tigercgi.lpi
lazbuild tigerclient.lpi
lazbuild tigerserver.lpi
2.2 With FreePascal:
- Run hgversion first to update the version info
fpc -dCGI tigercgi.lpr
fpc tigerserver.lpr

Installation instructions
=========================
- prerequisites: Linux/*nix (virtual) machine. Windows support may come later.
- prerequisites: have sane installed and configured for your scanner. E.g.:
  aptitude install sane-utils
- prerequisites: have tesseract installed and configured. E.g.:
  aptitude install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng #for English language support
  Note: we need version 3 because of hOCR support needed for getting searchable 
	PDFs.
- prerequisites: have exactimage installed (for hocr2pdf), e.g.:
  aptitude install exactimage
- Tesseract must/can then be configured to output hocr, e.g.:
  check you have this file present (adjust config directory to your situation):
  cat /usr/local/share/tessdata/configs/hocr
  If not (again, adjust config file location to your situation):
  cat >> /usr/local/share/tessdata/configs/hocr << "EOF_DOCUMENT"
  tessedit_create_hocr 1
  EOF_DOCUMENT
- nice to have: have scantailor installed (for aligning/cleaning up the tiff 
  images before OCR).
  see installation notes below
	
  
Installing the command line server:
- copy hocrwrap.sh to server directory (e.g. /opt/tigerserver/)
- copy scanwrap.sh to server directory
- copy tigerserver to server directory
- go to the server directory and make files executable, e.g. (replace 
  directory with your own if necessary):
  cd /opt/tigerserver/
  chmod u+rx hocrwrap.sh
  chmod u+rx scanwrap.sh
  chmod u+rx tigerserver
- copy tigerserver.ini.template to tigerserver.ini and edit settings to match 
  your environment

Test by running ./tigerserver --help

Installing the cgi application:
- prerequisites: apache2 or another HTTP server that supports cgi
  aptitude install apache2
-	copy tigercgi to cgi directory (e.g. /usr/lib/cgi-bin). 
	Make sure the user Apache runs under may read and execute the file (e.g. 
	chmod ugo+rx tigercgi)
- copy hocrwrap.sh to cgi directory (e.g. /usr/lib/cgi-bin/)
- copy scanwrap.sh to cgi directory
- copy tigercgi to cgi directory
- copy tigerserver.ini.template to tigerserver.ini in the cgi directory and edit
  settings to match your environment
- go to the cgi directory and make files executable for the apache/www user, 
  e.g. (replace directory with your own if necessary):
  cd /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
	# replace user/groups below with correct user/group if needed, e.g. apache2
  chown www-data:www-data hocrwrap.sh 
  chown www-data:www-data scanwrap.sh
  chown www-data:www-data tigercgi
  chown www-data:www-data tigerserver.ini
	# make scripts executable:
  chmod u+rx hocrwrap.sh
  chmod u+rx scanwrap.sh
  chmod u+rx tigercgi
  chmod u+r  tigerserver.ini
  
Installing the client:
- prerequisites: *nix: imagemagick dev libraries installed: e.g. 
  aptitude install imagemagick
- prerequisites: Windows: imagemagick DLLs e.g. Q16 x86 or x64 (depending on 
  papertiger client bitness) version downloaded from 
	http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php in client directory or 
	in path
- copy tigerclient.ini.template to tigerclient.ini and edit settings to match 
  your environment


Building Tesseract 3
====================
If tesseract 3 is not available for your platform, you will need to build it.

Miscellaneous notes
===================
Getting PDF viewers to open a certain page:
Adobe Acrobat Reader
http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters.pdf
acrobat.exe /A "page=<pageNo>"
could also use "nameddest=<named destination>"

SumatraPDF
https://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/wiki/CommandLineArguments
sumatrapdf -reuse-instance -page <pageNo>
Scrolls the first indicated file to the indicated page.
Tells an already open SumatraPDF to load the indicated files. If there are 
several running instances, behaviour is undefined.
